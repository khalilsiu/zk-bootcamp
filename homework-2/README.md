### 1. Take the set of bits B = {0,1} and the operation + 
### Does the set B and the operation + satisfy the group properties?
Closure - yes Associativity - yes Identity element = 0 yes Inverse element - yes, the element itself.

### 2.1 Is it true that all odd squares are = 1 mod 8
Answer: Yes e.g. 11^2 mod 8 = 1, 153^2 mod 8 = 1
### 2.2 What about even squares mod 8
Answer: No e.g. 2^2 mod 8 = 4, 152^2 mod 8 = 0

### 4. What do you understand by 
1. O(n) - it means that the time complexity increases in proportion to the increase of the number of inputs to the program
2. O(1) - it means that the time complexity does not increase as the number of input to the increase of the inputs to the program
3. O(log n) - it means that the rate of the increase of the time complexity of the program follows log n, which is lower than that of O(n)

### 5. Which of those is best when describing a proof size
O(1) and O(log n) would be the best because a proof is suppose to be succinctness is necessary for proofs that it has to be small in size for storing and verification efficiencies.
